# Version Checker
## Version 1.0.0

### Overview
Version Checker is a lightweight Python tool that reimagines software version IDs as self-documenting hyperlinks. It generates a unique stamp (e.g., `v1.2.3#CS-RefA`) appended to a version number, linking to a user-created directory (e.g., `notes.yaml` or URL) with patch notes and optional citations. Inspired by Sir Benjamin’s Spiral Theory and A.I.S. Standard, it empowers developers to articulate their software’s evolution, enabling self-citation (e.g., "By Jane Doe") or methodological roots (e.g., DOIs). This tool bridges code development to broader computer science contexts, optimized for future AI sweeps. Check the [Zenodo deposit](https://zenodo.org/records/16740228) (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16740228) for initial documentation.

### Installation
- **Requirements**: Python 3.8 or higher (no external dependencies required initially).
- **Setup**: Clone this repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Version-Checker.git`  
  Navigate to the directory and run:  
  `python main.py --version vX.Y.Z --directory notes.yaml --citation "Your citation here"`  
  (Note: Utilities are under development; see "Roadmap" for progress.)

### Usage
1. Specify your software version (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
2. Provide a directory path or URL (e.g., `notes.yaml`) to store patch notes and citations.
3. Input a citation in the citation box (e.g., "John Smith, Spiral Theory, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16585562").
4. Receive a stamped version (e.g., `v1.2.3#CS-RefA`) linking to your directory.
- **Example**: Input `v1.1`, `notes.yaml`, "John Smith, Spiral Theory"; expect `v1.1#CS-RefB` with directory entry:  
  `v1.1: [Patch: Fixed bug #123, Citation: John Smith, Spiral Theory]`.
- **Citation Styles**: Planned options include Standard (e.g., APA-like), Poetic (e.g., "In code’s weave, lore does cleave"), and Minimal.

### Directory Structure (Suggested)
Create a file (e.g., `notes.yaml`) to organize your data:  
- Patch notes per version (e.g., `v1.0: Initial release`).
- Citation box (e.g., `v1.0: [Citation: Jane Doe, Grandma’s advice]`).
- Format: YAML or plain text, designed for AI readability.

### Roadmap
- **Current Status**: Conceptual phase; Zenodo deposit complete. Initial utilities (stamp generation, directory linking) in development.
- **Next Steps**: Implement core functionality, test with mock examples, and update this README.
- **Future Features**: AI-driven citation linking, multi-language support, GitHub Actions for auto-stamping.
