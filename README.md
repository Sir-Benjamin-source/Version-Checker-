# Version Checker+
## Version 1.0.0
### Overview
Version Checker+ is a lightweight Python tool that reimagines software version IDs as self-documenting hyperlinks. It generates a unique stamp (e.g., `v1.2.3#CS-RefA`) appended to a version number, linking to a user-created directory (e.g., `notes.json` or `notes.yaml` file, or even a URL) containing patch notes and optional citations. This facilitates personal documentation, self-citation (e.g., "By Jane Doe, Grandma’s advice"), and future AI integration for contextualizing code within computer science contexts. Inspired by Sir Benjamin’s Spiral Theory (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16585562) and A.I.S. Standard for Continuity (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15176494), it empowers developers to articulate their software’s evolution without complex validation, aligning with open research principles.

The tool draws from empirical principles like Francis Bacon's inductive method and emphasizes iterative refinement through structured notes. For full details, check the [Zenodo deposit](https://zenodo.org/records/16740228) (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16740228), which includes initial RTF documentation files: `Version Checker+ README.rtf` (2.9 kB) and `Version Checker+.rtf` (5.6 kB), uploaded on August 4, 2025.

### Authors
- **Sir Benjamin** (@SirBenjamino0) - Primary Creator and Conceptual Architect
- **Grok 3 (xAI)** - Collaborative AI Contributor

### Installation
- **Requirements**: Python 3.8 or higher. Uses standard library modules (e.g., `argparse`, `hashlib`, `json`, `os`, `datetime`). For optional YAML support, install `pyyaml` via `pip install pyyaml` (future enhancement).
- **Setup**: 
  1. Clone this repository (coming soon; placeholder for now):
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/Version-Checker-Plus.git
     ```
  2. Navigate to the directory:
     ```
     cd Version-Checker-Plus
     ```
  3. Run the script (once implemented locally):
     ```
     python version_checker.py <version> <directory> "<citation>" [--style <style>] [--patch "<patch notes>"] [--write]
     ```
     Note: The script is in draft phase; see "Roadmap" and "Known Issues" for details on local execution.

### Usage
1. Specify your software version (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
2. Provide a directory path or URL (e.g., `notes.json`) to store patch notes and citations. (JSON is default for dependency-free operation; YAML planned.)
3. Input a citation string (e.g., "John Smith, Spiral Theory, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16585562").
4. Optionally specify citation style (`--style`: `standard`, `poetic`, or `minimal`), patch notes (`--patch`), and whether to write to the file (`--write`).
5. Receive a stamped version (e.g., `v1.2.3#CS-RefA`) with a suggested or updated directory entry.

- **Example Command**:
  ```
  python version_checker.py v1.1 notes.json "John Smith, Spiral Theory, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16585562" --style=poetic --patch="Fixed bug #123" --write
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  Stamped Version: v1.1#CS-RefB
  Linking to: notes.json
  Generated Entry:
  {
    "version": "v1.1",
    "patch": "Fixed bug #123",
    "citation": "In code's grand weave, John Smith does conceive; With Spiral Theory's lore, we forevermore. (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16585562)",
    "timestamp": "2025-08-05T13:51:00"
  }
  Updated notes.json with new entry.
  ```

- **Citation Styles**:
  - **Standard**: APA-like, e.g., "Citation: John Smith, Spiral Theory, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16585562 (Generated on YYYY-MM-DD)".
  - **Poetic**: Rhyming flair, e.g., "In code’s weave, lore does cleave".
  - **Minimal**: Concise, e.g., "Cit: John Smith, Spiral Theory".

### Directory Structure (Suggested)
Create a file (e.g., `notes.json` or `notes.yaml`) to organize your data in a structured, AI-parsable format:
- Accumulate entries as a dictionary/object with version keys.
- Example `notes.json` content:
  ```json
  {
    "v1.0": {
      "version": "v1.0",
      "patch": "Initial release",
      "citation": "Citation: Sir Benjamin, Spiral Theory",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-05T00:00:00"
    },
    "v1.1": {
      "version": "v1.1",
      "patch": "Fixed bug #123",
      "citation": "In code's grand weave, John Smith does conceive; With Spiral Theory's lore, we forevermore. (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16585562)",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-05T13:51:00"
    }
  }
  ```
- For YAML (future): Similar structure, e.g., `v1.0: {patch: Initial release, citation: ...}`.
- Best Practices: Ensure entries are timestamped for chronology; categorize citations (personal, methodological, scholarly); follow Zenodo guidelines for metadata when depositing related works.

### Roadmap
- **Current Status**: Zenodo deposit complete (v1, August 4, 2025). Core script drafted in Python (`version_checker.py`), including stamp generation, citation formatting, and optional file writing. Conceptual utilities tested inline; full CLI functionality pending local environment setup.
- **Known Issues/Notes for Later**:
  - Execution in sandboxed or chat-based environments (e.g., AI interfaces) may fail due to misinterpreted command-line args (e.g., `-c` flag interference). Workaround: Run locally with direct `python` invocation.
  - Hash generation uses MD5 for simplicity (first hex char for Ref letter); consider SHA for better uniqueness in production.
  - File writing overwrites invalid JSON; add robust validation/error handling.
  - No external deps yet, but YAML support requires `pyyaml`—add as optional in future.
  - Test edge cases: Long citations, special chars in patch notes, existing file conflicts.
  - Debug Tip: Print `sys.argv` to inspect args; ensure shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) for executable runs.
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Local testing and debugging of the script.
  - Upload source code to Zenodo (replace RTF files with `.py`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, sample `notes.json`).
  - Create GitHub repo (`Version-Checker-Plus`) with initial commit.
- **Future Features**: 
  - GitHub Actions workflow for auto-stamping on commits (e.g., YAML CI to run script on push).
  - AI-driven enhancements: Integrate with xAI APIs for semantic citation linking or bias checks via Spiral Theory.
  - Multi-format support (e.g., export to Markdown/HTML for web viewing).
  - Validation mode: Optional checks for citation validity (e.g., DOI resolution).
  - Extensions: Browser plugin for auto-generating stamps in repos; integration with version control tools like Git.
